## Overview:
This app is built using Node.js and Express, integrated with MongoDB as the database. The application enables parents to register themselves along with details about their children and caregivers. During registration, the parent uploads images for themselves, their children, and caregivers. The app stores these images on the server and saves relevant data to the MongoDB database.

## How to run:
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Set up a .env file with the following:
  DATABASE_URL=<your_mongodb_url>, PORT=<your_preferred_port>
- Run the app: npm run dev
